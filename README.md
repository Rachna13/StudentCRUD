Overview

StudentCRUD is a full-stack application for managing student records. Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data stored in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. 
The frontend is built with React.js, and the backend uses Node.js and Express.js.

Notes
The service account JSON and credentials are excluded from the repo. You need token.json for authentication.
